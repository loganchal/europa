This is a simple proof of concept new model was created in python to model processes on Europa. The goal of this model is to assess the stability of proposed subsurface configurations while remaining a relatively simple model. 

The unknown subsurface structure makes giving specific quantitative predictions as to real world configuration difficult.  

The model appears viable at assessing different stability states. 

The model takes a few parameters of the planet in question, geothermal heat flux to the ocean, the love number, tidal heating coefficient, gravity, albedo, solar radiation flux and hydrosphere depth. It also uses some physical constants and takes spatial and temporal resolution specifications. Finally, an initial starting temperature profile is read into the model.
