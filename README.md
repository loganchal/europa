# Europa Ocean Model

This repository contains a small Python model that simulates a possible internal ocean on Europa created as a projeft for EASC10125, Planetary Science at the University of Edinburgh. The code can be run from the command line or through a simple Streamlit GUI that lets you adjust parameters and view the resulting temperature profile.

## Running the simulation

Install requirements and run the model directly:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python model.py
```

## Interactive web app

To explore the model with sliders and number inputs run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This launches a local web page where you can tune planetary parameters and watch the temperature profile update.

## Next steps
Ideally, the values here will be physically constrained, we don't know how deep the ice layer is but suspect there is a liqud ocean underneath. The characteristics of that ocean could be important to determine if it has the capacity to support life.
