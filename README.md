# Europa Ocean Model

This repository contains a small Python model that simulates a possible internal ocean on Europa. The code can be run from the command line or through a simple Streamlit GUI that lets you adjust parameters and view the resulting temperature profile.

## Running the simulation

Install requirements and run the model directly:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python model.py
```

## Interactive web app

To explore the model with sliders and number inputs run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This launches a local web page where you can tune planetary parameters and watch the temperature profile update.
